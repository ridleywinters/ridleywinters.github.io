I tend to consider boilerplate code common text that _must be_ repeated to properly structure or specify another piece of _non-common_ configuration or otherwise unique code. (Note: my personal definition is _very_ different from [AWS\' definition](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/boilerplate-code/) which portrays \\"boilerplate\\" as a positive).  By \\"must be repeated\\", I\'m alluding to the kind of code that cannot be encapsulated easily into a reusable function, library, or other standard language primitive -- let\'s ignore macros certainly blur that line and just run with this hand-wavy definition!\\n\\nIn the context of creating _many different wgpu programs_, I can see how repeating the exact same configuration would constitue a good deal of \\"boilerplate code.\\" However, that commonality could be easily wrapped into a reusable library, which -- if we\'re willing to run with my definition of boilerplate code! -- means it is not boilerplate code as the code does not have the quality that it \\"must be\\" repeated.\\n\\nIn the context of a single program, wgpu strikes me simply as a very low-level library with detailed, highly structured configuration."}]}}')}}]);
