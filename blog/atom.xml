<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-read-a-comment-along-the-lines-of-wgpu-has-so-much-boilerplate">I read a comment along the lines of "wgpu has so much boilerplate"<a href="https://ridleywinters.github.io/blog/2024/08/10/index#i-read-a-comment-along-the-lines-of-wgpu-has-so-much-boilerplate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I read a comment along the lines of &quot;wgpu has so much boilerplate&quot;" title="Direct link to I read a comment along the lines of &quot;wgpu has so much boilerplate&quot;">â€‹</a></h4>
<p>Though pedantic, I'd argue wgpu has a lot of <em>configuration</em>. I tend to consider boilerplate code common text that <em>must be</em> repeated to properly structure or specify another piece of <em>non-common</em> configuration or otherwise unique code. (Note: my personal definition is <em>very</em> different from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/boilerplate-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS' definition</a> which portrays "boilerplate" as a positive).  By "must be repeated", I'm alluding to the kind of code that cannot be encapsulated easily into a reusable function, library, or other standard language primitive -- let's ignore macros certainly blur that line and just run with this hand-wavy definition!</p>
<p>In the context of creating <em>many different wgpu programs</em>, I can see how repeating the exact same configuration would constitue a good deal of "boilerplate code." However, that commonality could be easily wrapped into a reusable library, which -- if we're willing to run with my definition of boilerplate code! -- means it is not boilerplate code as the code does not have the quality that it "must be" repeated.</p>
<p>In the context of a single program, wgpu strikes me simply as a very low-level library with detailed, highly structured configuration.</p>]]></content>
