            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've started work on a project entitled <strong>Snowfield</strong>.  What is it? It's an adventure game in a vast, procedurally generated world akin to Daggerfall with a the lighthearted, fantastical tone of the classic King's Quest series. It takes place in the world of Galthea, a sci-fi / fantasy settings with a mix of low-fantasy and technological elements.</p>
<p>Snowfield itself is essentially a gameplay prototype for a future project "Snowglobe."  Snowfield is overhead 2D with minimal color graphics. It's being used to figure out the game play systems, learn Rust, and essentially flesh out the design for the more ambitious Snowglobe project. Snowglobe, by contrast, intends to be a 3D voxel-based world.</p>]]></content:encoded>
